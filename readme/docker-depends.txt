Problem: multiple running containers use the same image and we only want to build once.
Solution: Two docker-compose files. One to build (build.yml), one to run (docker-compose.yml).
usage:
docker-compose -f build.yml build
docker-compose run up

Problem: containers depend on other containers running.
Solution: https://github.com/ufoscout/docker-compose-wait
The wait for is specified as host:port in docker-compose
